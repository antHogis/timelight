- Light cycle
	- Timed cycles for morning,noon,afternoon,evening,night.
	- Transitions between cycles
	- Specific colour distributions for different cycles.
		- Use subset of cycle's colour distribution to create frames within the cycles.
		  Transition between frames for dynamic effect.
- Some cli options might be nice, like version
- Versioning script
- TOML config
	- toml11 seems like an ok lib
	- Configuration of the size of the light matrix
	- Configuration of the cycles' colour distributions
	- Configuration of the times the cycles are activated
- Different effects?
	- Waves?
	- Flame-like flickering practically implemented
- Arduino adapter
